**Intro:** Molly’s Game is a biographical crime drama based on the true story of a 26-year-old woman who organized an exclusive underground poker game. The movie swiftly reveals how an injury took her out of competitive skiing, bringing her into the dark side of money and poker, and how her poker adventures brought her close to the FBI.

**Summary:** The thrilling story of Molly Bloom was first introduced in a book published in 2014, which carries the same name as the movie. Aaron Sorkin, who has previously written the screenplay for films like Moneyball and The Social Network (he won Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay), decided to make his directorial debut with the story of the “Poker Princess.”

The movie stars Jessica Chastain in the titular role, while Idris Elba, Kevin Costner, and Michael Cera play the supporting characters. Aaron Sorkin bagged Best Screenwriter and Best Adaptive Screenplay awards from the AARP Movies for Grownups Awards and the Los Angeles Online Film Critics Society Awards with Golden Globe and Oscars nominations.

**Plot:** The movie centers on the true story of "Hollywood’s poker princess," who has gambled everything, won big, and then lost it all. It incorporates a non-linear narrative to take us through her crushing injury, overbearing father, venturing into the poker world, and succumbing to the weight of the powerful. We see her journey from the undergrounds of LA to the towering heights of New York until she fell under the radar of the FBI.

With fast-paced intercuts and a scintillating background score, the film keeps our attention steady. Driven mainly by dialogue, this movie will demand a certain level of attention. This movie deftly explores the ups and downs of Molly Bloom’s life. Though the movie underscores that she has not committed any serious crime, it keeps you second-guessing where the movie leads and questions one’s moral stand.

I was hired to win,” says Elizabeth Sloane, the titular character of this movie, played by the brilliant Jessica Chastain. A political drama directed by John Madden perfectly screens the world of politics and political power brokers. Elizabeth Sloane, who has a moral compass, is led into a gun lobby case where the head of the gun lobby calls her to help convince women to oppose a bill that will impose new regulations on the sale of firearms. However, as a person who sees every threat as an opportunity, she latches on and follows through with the case and the dark world behind it.
