**Intro:** After the breakout success of The Hangover, Todd Phillips co-wrote and directed [“Due Date,”](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1231583/) which is loosely inspired by the 1987 movie Planes, Trains and Automobiles. This road trip comedy explores what happens when an anxious father-to-be is forced to road-trip with a stranger he can’t stand.

Starring Zach Galifianakis and [Robert Downey Jr.](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000375/), this movie is all about the chaotic energy that you usually associate with the Hangover series. Both Galifianakis (The Hangover) and RDJ (coming fresh off Iron Man 2) were riding high when they took this project. While the movie was not critically acclaimed, fans loved it for its absurd plot and great handling of the dark humor genre.

**Plot:** Peter Highman, played by Robert Downey Jr., reaches Atlanta airport to get home in time for the birth of his first child, but his encounter with Ethan, played by Zach Galifianakis, derails his schedule. The movie follows a series of disaster events right after Peter steps out of the cab at the airport. What started as a bag switch argument between the two ends led to them getting banned from the airlines.

[Zach Galifianakis](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0302108/) plays a disaster magnet who invites unwelcome scenarios. They travel cross-country in a rented car, eventually discovering newfound friendships, the dark side of Ethan, and the stress of becoming a father. Apart from the nerve-wrecking crash, arrest, and police car theft, this road trip movie also featured cameos by [Jamie Foxx](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004937/), Juliette Lewis, and Michelle Monaghan as Peter's wife.

**Summary:** While the movie leans on familiar road movie tropes, Due Date stands out for its sharp performances and moments of unexpected sincerity. Lawrence Sher's cinematography beautifully captures the changing landscape. Fast-paced editing matches the story's chaos while ensuring the comedy lands firmly. Todd Phillips also let Galifianakis improvise on set, which resulted in some of the most iconic awkward or bizarre lines.

A screenwriter sued Warner Bros., claiming that Due Date was stolen from his unpublished script. The case never made it far but added controversy to the film’s release. Due Date blends absurd slapstick with moments of genuine emotion. While it doesn’t reinvent the buddy comedy formula, it delivers laughs through sharp timing, strong performances, and unexpected emotional beats.

## List of *“Due Date”* like movies, you might have missed

The comedy genre has always been a roller coaster ride of joy, emotion, supported by an under- or over-performing cast. No matter the weather, comedy movies have always been on everyone's watch list. Here are five movies that will surely crack you up if you enjoy the road trip with Due Date.

## #5 Get him to the Greek (2010)

[Get him to the Greek](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226229/), starring Jonah Hill and Russell Brand in the lead roles, focuses on an aspiring music executive assigned to deliver a rock star for his comeback concert. This movie takes a humorous jab at the music industry and the fame culture. This movie is a story about confronting one’s flaws and the commercialization of art.

**Director**: [Nicholas Stoller](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0831557/)

**Written by:** Nicholas Stoller

**Based on:** Characters by [Jason Segel](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0781981/)

**Awards:** Nominated for the Critics' Choice Award in 2011

[**Where to watch**](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/get-him-to-the-greek)

**Summary:** The movie follows Aaron Green, a music label executive intern, tasked with finding Aldous Snow, a failed rockstar, to perform at the Greek Theater in L.A. within 72 hours. What follows is a journey into the drug-filled undergrounds of the music industry and a cross-continental journey to explore the personal revelations.

The film is a spin-off of Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008), in which Russell Brand first played Aldous Snow. It features cameos by Lars Ulrich, Pink, Christina Aguilera, and Sean “Diddy” Combs. Similar to the Due Date, the movie doesn’t go for subtlety but instead aims for chaos, and it mostly hits the mark.

## #4 War Dogs (2016)

In this movie, Todd Phillips shifts the gear from directing The Hangover to arms dealing in Iraq. Inspired by a true story, the War Dogs cast includes Whiplash's star Miles Teller and ever-humorous Jonah Hill for this dramedy. It narrates the journey of two childhood friends involved in the lucrative but shady business of global arms dealing.

**Director:** Todd Phillips

**Screenplay by:** Stephen Chin, Todd Phillips, Jason Smilovic

**Cinematography:** Lawrence Sher

**Based on:** ["Arms and the Dudes" by Guy Lawson](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/the-complete-story-of-the-300-million-stoner-arms-dealers-160311/)

[**Where to watch**](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/war-dogs)

**Summary:** War Dogs is about two friends in their early twenties who had secured a $300 million deal to arm the Afghan Military. What was assumed to be a business journey turned into a chase by perilous people and the involvement of the U.S. government. Similar to the Due Date, the movie involves a dangerous and comic road trip through the valley of death.

This movie makes you want to rethink war profiteering, moral ambiguity, and the illusion of the American dream. The leads put out a charismatic performance and give life to the story, inspired by a real-life story published by the Rolling Stones in 2011. The movie glosses over socio-political problems and blends them with sarcasm.

## #3 Horrible Bosses (2011)

A comedy movie about three friends who plan to kill their bosses and their master plan to control the company. [Jason Bateman](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000867/), Jason Sudeikis, and [Charlie Day](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0206359/) hire a 'professional' to execute their plan. The generic comedy touches upon toxic work culture and the exploitation of power.

**Director:** [Seth Gordon](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1164861/)

**Screenplay by:** Michael Markowitz, John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein

**Cinematography:** David Hennings

**Story by:** [Michael Markowitz](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002864/)

**Awards:**

MTV Movie & TV Award for Best Villain in 2012

Nominated for the Critics' Choice Award in 2012

[**Where to watch**](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/horrible-bosses-uncut)

**Summary:** The movie is a noir-comedy of masculinity seeking revenge, but it seems like a hatchet murder plan by three employees against tyrannical bosses. Kevin Spacey as a corporate bully, manipulative Colin Farrell with less screen time, and Jennifer Aniston as a sexually aggressive dentist are the titular bosses who have victimized their employees.

[*Horrible Bosses*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1499658/) follows a comedy storyline of intimidation and blackmail, including sexual harassment. Jamie Foxx's appearance as a twitchy ex-con also ensures additional laughs. Meanwhile, screenwriters Michael Markowitz, John Francis Daley, and Jonathan Goldstein perfectly employ a comedy script that is easily relatable to those who work 9 to 5.

## #2 We're the Millers (2013)

This is another road-trip movie like the Due Date, but this one involves more crime, intensity, and drugs laced with humor. [*We're the Millers*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1723121/) follows a weed dealer who, after being robbed, is forced to take a trip to Mexico with his boss. For his assignment, he devised a camouflage with a fake family to transport a massive shipment of weed into the US from Mexico. What makes every scene hilarious is the comedy that comes from a dysfunctional, fake family pretending to be normal.

**Director:** [Rawson Marshall Thurber](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1098493/)

**Screenplay by:** Bob Fisher, Steve Faber, Sean Anders, John Morris

**Cinematography:** Barry Peterson

**Story by:** [Bob Fisher](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1462097/), [Steve Faber](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0264520/)

**Awards:**

MTV Movie & TV Award for Best Kiss in 2014

MTV Movie & TV Award for Best Breakthrough Performance in 2014

Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress in 2014

[**Where to watch**](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/were-the-millers)

**Summary:** Writers Bob Fisher and Steve Faber create a much funnier storyline than “Horrible Bosses.” Sudeikis plays David Clark, a small-time marijuana peddler who caters to upper-middle-class clientele. An epic journey will follow after David gets robbed of $43,000 worth of cash, and his wealthy supplier, Ed Helms, orders him to pick up a shipment across the border from Mexico.

The movie boasts strong chemistry between the cast and balances crude humor with warmth. While some might feel that the jokes haven’t aged well and rely too much on stereotypes, this movie is a solid entertainer and a comfort movie, with dysfunctional-family road-trip chaos.

## #1 The Hangover (2009)

This comedy movie has been a fan favorite with an irreplaceable cast. Their epic journey to Vegas will be remembered forever. [*The Hangover*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1119646/) is about three long-time friends who plan a weekend-long bachelor party in Vegas. As they retrace their steps, they uncover a trail of bizarre events involving a tiger, a stolen police car, a baby, and a mysterious man named Mr. Chow. They follow Todd Phillips’s trope of throwing unlikely people into chaos and letting the dysfunction drive both laughs and heart.

[**Where to watch**](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-hangover)

**Summary:** This movie will always be remembered for showcasing male bonding and the effortless chemistry between the cast. The film parodies the idea of "manhood" and presents how one night of reckless partying can spiral into chaos. It’s a rare mix of mystery, comedy, and adventure.

The film features a real tiger in a bathroom, a baby named Carlos, and Mike Tyson singing Phil Collins. Its randomness keeps you entertained even after multiple viewings. The film grossed over $460 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing R-rated comedy at the time. This inventive, raunchy, and absurdly funny ride became a pop-culture phenomenon for a reason.
