**Intro:** How far will you go to uncover a mystery? How does obsession affect your judgment and impact your life? Director David Fincher, who returned to films five years after his previous work, *Panic Room*, explores this idea in Zodiac. The movie follows the fabled story of the Zodiac Killer, who terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area between December 1968 and October 1969. 

An adaptation of Robert Graysmith's nonfiction books [Zodiac (1986)](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/105760.Zodiac) and [Zodiac Unmasked (2002)](https://books.apple.com/us/book/zodiac-unmasked/id357992964), this movie compiles definitive events and records such as police reports, eyewitness testimony, ciphers, handwriting, and fingerprints. In fact, the Zodiac Killer case remains one of the famous unsolved crimes in American history. The movie itself studies human obsession and touches upon nihilism, a constant trope in Fincher’s films.

**Plot:** On July 4, 1969, an unknown person attacks Darlene Ferrin (one of the victims of the Zodiac Killer) and Mike Mageau with a handgun at a lovers' lane in Vallejo, California. A month later, the San Francisco Chronicle received an encrypted letter written by the killer, "Zodiac," who threatens to kill a dozen people unless his coded message containing his identity is published. 

What follows is the pursuit of the crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), political cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), and San Francisco police inspectors Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) in cracking the code and finding the killer. While the circumstantial evidence points to a certain person, the justice system requires physical evidence. Where they found the killer and what sacrifices they had to make to crack the code formed the crux of this movie.  

**Summary:** When writer James Vanderbilt sent the script of Zodiac to David Fincher, he never expected Fincher to latch onto this story. However, as a child who spent his formative years in San Francisco, he instantly connected with the story. The writer and director were laser-focused on the fact that the film doesn’t depict any murder sequence in which there were no survivors to provide accurate details. 

This movie was a technical masterpiece and marked David Fincher’s first experiment with the digital camera. Donald Graham Burt’s meticulous production design makes the 1960s setting feel authentic. The movie showcases a period from the late 1960s to the mid-80s, and these shifts are marked by music as it shifts genres between jazz, R&B, and psychedelic folk rock. Zodiac has been acclaimed as one of the most definitive crime thrillers of the 21st century.

## #5: The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (2011)

This is another perfect representation of Fincher's ability to capture a murder mystery with a dark and unsettling backdrop. The movie offers the same essence of Zodiac in its investigative approach and delivers as many suspenseful scenes as expected. Moreover, it has also been reviewed as more compelling and thrilling than the original [2009 Swedish-Danish crime movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132620/).

## #4: Memories of Murder (2003)

Director Bong Joon-ho leaves no stone unturned when he released this epic crime-thriller. Memories of Murder showcases the story of South Korea's first serial killer case. Based on the serial murders in 1986, the movie offers an immersive experience with a mix of psychological tension, emotional depth, and the scope of real-life detective work, much like Zodiac.

[**Where to watch**](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/memories-of-murder)

**Summary:** This investigative thriller by [Bong Joon-ho](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0094435/) is an exhilarating South Korean crime drama based on an active serial killer in the 1980s. In the movie, Park Doo-man, played by Song Kang-ho, and Seo Tae-yoon, played by Kim Sang-kyung, are two detectives who seek to investigate and solve the mysterious, violent murder. However, the plot brings two distinct approaches to solving the case. 

The case of multiple murders in a small South Korean town traces the disagreement that looms between the two detectives and also draws the unfriendly relationship with the North. In a similar tone to Zodiac, the serial killer of this movie and the real-life murderer was never caught and conclusively identified, revealing the inefficiency of the investigative methods. 

## #3: No Man of God (2021)

If you are familiar with the notorious serial killer [Ted Bundy](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0120421/), this movie will intrigue you in exploring the mind of this infamous murderer. The movie is staged in an enclosed interrogation room and portrays the unsettling interaction between FBI analyst Bill Hagmaier and Ted Bundy. 

An interrogation that delves into the psychological profile of America's most infamous criminal, originally named Theodore Robert Bundy. The interaction reveals the killer's clinical observation on good and evil and the thin line drawn between empathy and manipulation. Similar to Zodiac, the movie also explored the cryptic mentality of the killer.

**Screenplay:** C. Robert Cargill, Kit Lesser 

**Written by:** C. Robert Cargill

**Cinematography:** Karina Silva

**Awards:** 

Nominated for the Golden Frog in 2021

Nominated for Chlotrudis Awards in 2022

[**Where to watch**](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/no-man-of-god)

**Summary:** This claustrophobic drama captures intense interviews with death row inmate Ted Bundy, where an FBI profiler played by [Elijah Wood](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000704/) digs into the mind of this serial killer. The suspenseful settings and rigorous taunts result in the true-life psycho killers confessing to the crimes committed. Luke Kirby's portrayal of Ted Bundy seems to have hit the right chord, including the physical resemblance, which is viewed as flawless. 

What's more enigmatic about [*No Man of God*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13507778/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1) is that the movie is adapted from a real-time audio tape recording. It reveals the eerie bond or relationship between Bundy and Bill Hagmaier during their interaction. In this calculative game of interaction, the plot centers on “knowing” Ted Bundy. 

## #2: Insomnia (2002)

Most movie enthusiasts are familiar with [Christopher Nolan](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634240/?ref_=fn_all_nme_1) and his mind-bending work, including films such as Memento, Prestige, and Inception. However, this movie is a psychological and intense detective thriller. Interestingly, this is the only movie he has not written or co-written, and is an adaptation of a remake of the Norwegian film of the same name. 

Insomnia follows the investigation of a teenager's murderer, where detective Will Dormer, played by Al Pacino, lands in a remote Alaskan town to investigate this grisly murder. The movie showcases him struggling with insomnia, which acts as a symbol of his inability to escape his own conscience.

**Director:** Christopher Nolan

**Cinematography:** Wally Pfister

**Awards:** 

Nominated for the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Motion Picture

London Critics Circle Film Award for British Director of the Year

[**Where to watch**](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/insomnia)

**Summary:** Insomnia is set in a small town in Alaska in the summer months following a brutal murder. The plot begins with seasoned detective Will Dormer, played by [Al Pacino](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_5_nm_3_in_0_q_%2520Al%2520Pacino), who has arrived in the Alaskan town with his partner. In the backdrop, Will's mind is threatened by Insomnia and his sanity when he accidentally shoots his partner. 

The chaotic settings become more intense when novelist Walter Finch, played by Robin Williams, witnesses the accidental shooting and begins blackmailing Dormer. This tragic incident compels the protagonist to undertake a morally challenging decision. This movie treads the line of moral ambiguity, with a psychological breakdown of Dormer’s character similar to the Zodiac. It also shows how small ethical compromises can spiral into something more evil. 

## #1: Silence of the Lambs (1991)

Saving the best for last, *The Silence of the Lambs* is a psychological thriller masterpiece and one of the greatest movies ever made about a serial killer. At the 64th Academy Awards, it clinched the top five Oscars. This movie examines various shades of evil behavior and the idea of instilling fear to manipulate others. 

The horror-suspense movie centers on young FBI trainee Clarice Starling, played by Jodie Foster, and the cannibalistic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter, played by Anthony Hopkins. In one of his most iconic roles, Hopkins helps the FBI locate "Buffalo Bill," another serial killer. Does Hannibal Lecter’s escape scene ring a bell?

[**Where to watch**](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-silence-of-the-lambs)

**Summary:** This movie reflects the cataclysmic image of a sociopathic and cannibalistic serial killer. In the movie, [Anthony Hopkins](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000164/)'s first appearance flawlessly manifested the look of a brilliant psychiatrist and a mass murderer. As the movie proceeds, “[Hannibal the Cannibal](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102926/characters/nm0000164/?ref_=tt_cl_c_2)” comes in contact with the FBI agent, Clarice Starling, who seeks his expertise in finding another mass murderer, “Buffalo Bill,” who skins his victims.

In this adaptation of Thomas Harris's best-selling novel, director Jonathan Demme produced a psychological thriller that delivers a bone-chilling experience with each watch. The never-dying character of Hannibal manifests how humanity, at times, unleashes unthinkable evils and how humankind can go wrong. Such dark narratives and haunting performances by iconic characters, such as John Carroll Lynch's in Zodiac, serve as milestones in the American psychological crime thriller.

Any “based on a true story” movie will instantly connect with the audience. Most might have heard of it, and maybe some of them lived through it. So they hook the audience as they imagine the reel characters playing the real-life characters, and the visual impact it leaves can be disturbing. Also, humans have a tendency to find a reason behind everything. An investigative thriller movie works well with the audience if it pulls it off with conviction. 

Also, the characters in these movies have relatable issues, and we might put ourselves in their shoes and imagine the movie. Moreover, the pacing is deliberate and slow, which makes us feel what the character is going through. These movies also build an eerie atmosphere that disturbs and haunts you, but above all, it all feels authentic and true to life.  

## Final thoughts: Why do the best movies like Zodiac​ keep you guessing?

As the characters in the movie unravel the mystery, we also tend to participate in the maze to resolve that particular case.
