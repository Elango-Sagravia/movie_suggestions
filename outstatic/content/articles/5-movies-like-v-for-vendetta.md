**Intro:** Does masked vigilantism hold its ground in the modern world? Do we need a mask to overthrow tyranny? A movie from DC’s Vertigo catalog (the Vertigo line is meant for adult themes) explores these ideas. Enter the world of V for Vendetta. Based on Alan Moore’s writing, the film is set in a distant British society and is a complex take against fascism and totalitarianism. This movie sets the precedent that when people are pushed to the extreme, they will rise against the authority.

This fantasy thriller portrays a future British dystopian society in which the titular character “V,” played by Hugo Weaving, unleashes a campaign to overthrow the tyrannical government. It also raises a concern about whether extremism is acceptable in the face of oppression. Do watch out for the character Evey, played by Natalie Portman, and her transformation in the rain scene.

**Summary:** The Wachowskis, who directed The Matrix trilogy, wrote the screenplay for this movie. Though the film was not critically acclaimed or won major awards, it has become a cult classic due to its resemblance to our society. The world is fighting against the rise of authoritarianism and surveillance. In a world where people's opinions can be easily swayed, the movie discusses the power of an idea and how to fight for it. 

The makers of the movie didn’t want to rely on Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI), so Natalie Portman shaved her head on camera, and 22,000 dominos were toppled for an iconic scene. Alan Moore, who wrote the original comic, disowned the film because he felt there was a difference in interpretation of his work. The film, filled with breathtaking visuals, iconic monologues, and deep political themes, has stood the test of time and has become more relevant than ever.  

**Plot:** Directed by James McTeigue, this movie takes inspiration and celebrates Guy Fawkes as a revolutionary hero. V adopts his mask to avenge the fascist regime of Norsefire, which has been ruling the country through fear and propaganda. 

The narrative follows Evey, who is rescued by V from the police. As the movie progresses, Evey is drawn to the world of V as she uncovers the dark secrets behind the concentration camps and understands the evil mindset of the people in power. Soon, however, she starts questioning V’s methods and wonders if he is becoming the thing he is fighting against. 

V  believes in extreme measures to stir up a rebellion mentality among the citizens. His ultimate goal is to take down the government on November 5, the anniversary of the actual Gunpowder plot. Whether V succeeded in his motive and lived to see the dream he envisioned forms the core of this politically charged movie that will question our moral compass. 

## Why movies like V for Vendetta still resonate today

As modern society moves forward, the clarity and alarm on political oppression are being raised. V for Vendetta is a film that will challenge the existing status quo and moral compass as it stirs your emotions. Moreover, the dramatic setups and the cinematography set this world beautifully. 

This film depicts the subversion of human freedom, and even critics see why V for Vendetta resonates with its relevance today. The less cryptic message on human rights and political freedom mirrored the essential elements of a modern-day democratic society. 

Audiences generally love a masked vigilante story as they feel a representative among them is questioning the authority. Also, the rebellion shown in this film can be empowering for many. Powerful dialogues such as “People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people” and “Beneath this mask, there is more than flesh. Beneath this mask, there is an idea, and ideas are bulletproof” will always remain relevant and evoke a sense of power. 

The theme of the film is what hooks the viewers and supporters. The film depicts a society caught in the undertow of anarchism, fascism, and the oppressive regime under the iron fist of the Norsefire government.
