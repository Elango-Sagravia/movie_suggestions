### We watched it

If you somehow missed The Godfather—though it’s not likely—it’s time to watch this cinematic masterpiece. Far more than a mobster movie, it explores power, loyalty, and betrayal within the Corleone family. It’s a complex story about family dynamics and the cost of ambition, driven by unforgettable performances from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. And after you're done with this one, continue the saga with *The Godfather: Part II* and *Part III*.
