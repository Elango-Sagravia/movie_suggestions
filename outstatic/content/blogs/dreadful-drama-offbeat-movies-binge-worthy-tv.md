### We Watched It

Aftersun is a quietly powerful drama that captures the fleeting, bittersweet moments of a father and daughter’s vacation in Turkey. As the days unfold, subtle hints of emotional depth and personal struggles begin to surface, turning what seems like a simple holiday into a poignant reflection on memory and growing up. Paul Mescal gives a beautifully restrained performance, while young Frankie Corio brings an authenticity that pulls you into their intimate world. This is a must-watch if you enjoy thoughtful, slice-of-life films like *Lady Bird* or *Moonlight*.

### Behind the Scenes

During filming, director Charlotte Wells encouraged Paul Mescal and Frankie Corio to improvise many scenes, leading to authentic, unscripted moments between them. The father-daughter bond feels real because the two actors spent time together off-set, often playing games and chatting as part of building their relationship.
