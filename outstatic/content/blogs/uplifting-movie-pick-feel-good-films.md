### We Watched it

This movie is for anyone who loves stories about personal growth. It follows Ada, a cleaning lady, as she sets out to buy a haute couture dress, leading her into the glamorous but intimidating world of 1950s Paris fashion. The film's humor is subtle, with moments that feel as real as a conversation with a friend. If you enjoyed *Cinderella*, you’ll love how Ada’s journey echoes that same kind of hopeful transformation. You’ll walk away feeling like you’ve been part of her journey, rooting for her every step of the way.
