### We Watched It

Hereditary is the kind of horror that sticks with you long after the lights come back on. What starts as a heartbreaking family tragedy evolves into something far more disturbing, with moments that will leave you speechless. Toni Collette’s performance is intense, maybe one of the most unsettling in recent memory. The film’s slow-burn tension, paired with its shocking twists, creates an eerie, suffocating atmosphere. If you’re into horror that messes with your mind and lingers long after, this one is a must-watch.

### Behind the Scenes

Director Ari Aster originally envisioned Hereditary as a family drama, with horror elements emerging organically as the story evolved. He even told the cast early on that they were making a drama about family trauma, keeping the supernatural elements somewhat hidden during production to maintain a sense of realism.

### 3 Psychological Horror Masterpieces

[The Babadook (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2321549/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_the%2520bab) – More than just a horror movie, this is an emotional exploration of grief wrapped in the guise of a supernatural thriller. The real terror comes from the psychological breakdown of a mother trying to cope with loss while protecting her son from a sinister force. This one is for you if you like horror films that leave you emotionally shaken as much as scared.

[Midsommar (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8772262/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_mids) – Set against the backdrop of a sunny Swedish festival, the film unnerves you with its bright, open spaces while descending into surreal, disturbing chaos. Its vivid visuals slowly build psychological tension, making the horror feel inescapable.

[The Others (2001)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230600/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_the%2520othe) is a gothic horror that thrives on atmosphere, with a slow-burn suspense that keeps you guessing until its mind-bending twist. It resembles classic ghost stories, with its dark, isolated mansion adding to the tension and mystery. This is a must-watch if you love psychological horror with a haunting twist that leaves you rethinking the entire story.

### Soundtrack of the Week

"Time" by Hans Zimmer from Inception (2010) – This powerful and emotionally charged track is the heartbeat of Inception, blending subtle intensity with sweeping orchestration. Its slow build captures the tension and depth of the film, making it one of Zimmer's most iconic compositions. If you haven’t seen Inception, now is a good time.
