### Behind the Scenes

For the iconic hallway fight scene, Christopher Nolan had a real rotating set built, so Joseph Gordon-Levitt could perform the stunts as the room spun around him. No CGI was used for the sequence, making the mind-bending visuals even more impressive. It took weeks of rehearsal and planning to perfect, and the result is one of the most memorable scenes in modern cinema.
