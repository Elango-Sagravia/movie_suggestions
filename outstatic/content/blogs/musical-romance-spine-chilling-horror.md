### 3 Horror Movies  

[The Babadook (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2321549/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_7_nm_1_in_0_q_the%2520baba) is an emotional gut-punch disguised as a horror film. It explores the overwhelming weight of grief and motherhood. The terror comes not just from the sinister figure haunting the characters but also from the psychological unraveling of a mother trying to cope with loss. If you're into horror that leaves you thinking long after it's over, this one will stick with you. It is more unsettling than outright scary.

[It Follows (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3235888/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_it%2520follows) is an instant favorite for horror fans looking for something different. The plot revolves around a supernatural curse passed through sexual encounters, but it’s the relentless feeling of dread that makes it memorable. It’s not full of jump scares, but instead, it builds a constant sense of paranoia.

[The Conjuring (2013)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1457767/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_the%2520conju) taps into classic haunted house horror, and it does so expertly. It balances suspense, tension, and solid scares without leaning too heavily on gore. Based on true paranormal investigations, the film keeps you on edge with its well-crafted pacing and old-school ghost story vibes. If you’re into ghost stories or supernatural films, this is one of the best of the modern era.
